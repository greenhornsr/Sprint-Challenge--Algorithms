#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) exponential O(n)
    a single operation ran on n

b) constant n(log(n))
    as the number n increases the runtime /space used will grow at a slightly slower rate 

c)  O(bunnies)
    operation runs for every bunny


## Exercise II
Answer:
    Start at ground floor(0) of building with (n) floors
        drop an egg, 
        if egg doesn't break    
            move to the next floor
        else 
            f = current floor
        return eggs break at f or higher.

    runtime complexity: O(n)
# n = story building
# f = floor
# ~ eggs
# break = f floor + 
# not break = f floor -
