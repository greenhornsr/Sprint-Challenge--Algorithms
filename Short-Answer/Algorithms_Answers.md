#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) exponential O(a^n)
    as the size of the input increases the runtime or space used will grow at a faster rate.

b) constant O(n)
    if n is 1 or 0; Only looping through 1 set of data capped by n; the operation will only go a set number of times based on n
    otherwise, I am not sure how to apply BIG O notation to an infinite loop.
    while j < n and n is never altered...

c)  O(1)
    operation is unaffected by n
